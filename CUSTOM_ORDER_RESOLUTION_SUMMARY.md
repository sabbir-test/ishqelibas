# Custom Design Order Creation/Storage - Resolution Summary

## 🎯 Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Missing order creation/storage for custom design checkout flow, preventing custom orders from appearing in 'My Orders' and order confirmation pages.

**Root Cause**: Orders were being created correctly, but demo user orders were being filtered out by overly restrictive filtering logic that treated `demo@example.com` as dummy data.

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### 1. API Endpoint Coverage ✅
- **Status**: Active API endpoint exists at `/api/orders` (POST)
- **Functionality**: Properly handles custom order creation with full data transmission
- **Custom Design Support**: Complete support for custom blouse and salwar kameez designs

### 2. Database Schema ✅
- **Status**: Valid schema exists with all required tables
- **Tables**: `orders`, `order_items`, `custom_orders`, `addresses`, `users`
- **Relationships**: Properly defined foreign keys and relations
- **Custom Fields**: Complete measurement storage and design details

### 3. Order Creation Workflow ✅
- **Backend Logic**: Correctly processes and inserts custom order data
- **Transaction Handling**: Proper database operations with error handling
- **Data Mapping**: All custom design fields properly mapped and stored

### 4. End-to-End Flow ✅
- **Order Creation**: Successfully saves custom orders to database
- **Order Retrieval**: Orders appear correctly in 'My Orders' after filtering fix
- **Confirmation Page**: Order details properly displayed using orderId

## 🛠️ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Order Filtering Logic
**File**: `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`

**Before**: Demo users filtered out as dummy data
```typescript
const dummyEmailPatterns = [
  /^demo@example\./i,  // This was filtering out demo@example.com
  /^dummy@/i,
  // ...
]
```

**After**: Allow demo users while filtering actual dummy data
```typescript
const dummyEmailPatterns = [
  /^dummy@/i,
  /^sample@/i,
  /^fake@/i,
  /^placeholder@/i,
  /^noreply@/i,
  /^donotreply@/i,
  /^test-dummy@/i
]
// demo@example.com is now allowed as a legitimate test account
```

### 2. Enhanced Custom Order Processing
- ✅ Virtual products (`custom-blouse`, `custom-salwar-kameez`) properly created
- ✅ Custom order records linked to main orders
- ✅ Measurement data stored in JSON format
- ✅ Design details properly captured and stored
