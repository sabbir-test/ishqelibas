# Invoice Data Completeness and Download Button Fix - Implementation Report

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. Invoice Data Completeness
- **Problem**: Downloaded invoices showed "N/A" for bill/ship address fields
- **Root Cause**: Invoice generation was not properly utilizing address data from the linked address table
- **Solution**: Enhanced address data mapping with proper fallback logic

### 2. Product Design Details Missing
- **Problem**: Product design details (front design name, price, etc.) were not shown on invoices
- **Root Cause**: Limited product information retrieval and display
- **Solution**: Enhanced product details with custom design information

### 3. Download Button Functionality

- **Solution**: Implemented proper download functionality for both pages

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/app/api/orders/[id]/invoice/route.ts`
**Enhanced invoice generation with complete address data:**

```typescript
// Enhanced address data mapping
const billingAddress = order.address ? {
  name: `${order.address.firstName || ''} ${order.address.lastName || ''}`.trim() || order.user.name || 'Customer',
  phone: order.address.phone || order.user.phone || 'N/A',
  address: order.address.address || order.user.address || 'N/A',
  city: order.address.city || order.user.city || 'N/A',
  state: order.address.state || order.user.state || 'N/A',
  pincode: order.address.zipCode || order.user.zipCode || 'N/A',
  country: order.address.country || order.user.country || 'India'
} : {
  // Fallback to user data
  name: order.user.name || 'Customer',
  phone: order.user.phone || 'N/A',
  address: order.user.address || 'N/A',
  city: order.user.city || 'N/A',
  state: order.user.state || 'N/A',
  pincode: order.user.zipCode || 'N/A',
  country: order.user.country || 'India'
}
```

#### 2. `/src/app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`

  onClick={() => {
    const invoiceUrl = `/api/orders/${order.id}/invoice`
    const link = document.createElement('a')
    link.href = invoiceUrl
    link.download = `Invoice-${order.orderNumber}.html`
    link.target = '_blank'
    document.body.appendChild(link)
    link.click()
    document.body.removeChild(link)
  }}
>
  <Download className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
